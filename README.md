# Tickflow syntax highlighting for [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com)
A collection of resources to add Tickflow syntax highlighting that is context aware (example: hex numbers that represent subroutines are colored differently than hex numbers used as values).  
Color scheme is based on Notepad++ and the original color scheme provided with [Tickflow](https://github.com/rhmodding/Tickompiler).

## Installation
(I'm looking into making a package, but for now...)  
Put the files in the Sublime Text folder (which you can find via Preferences-> Browse Packages) as shown below

    ├── Packages
    │   ├── Tickflow.sublime-syntax
    │   └── User
    │       ├── Tickflow.sublime-settings
    │       └── Tickflow.sublime-color-scheme
    
## Purpose
Makes navigation easier; provides tickflow syntax support for a program that is natively supported by Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

## In the works
1. Build automation
2. Snippet/template files
