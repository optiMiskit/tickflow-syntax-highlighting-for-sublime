# Tickflow syntax highlighting for [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com)
A collection of resources to add Tickflow syntax highlighting that is context aware (example: hex numbers that represent subroutines are colored differently than hex numbers used as values).  
Color scheme is based on Notepad++ and the original color scheme provided with [Tickompiler](https://github.com/rhmodding/Tickompiler).
